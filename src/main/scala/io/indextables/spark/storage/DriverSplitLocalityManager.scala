/**
 * Driver-based split locality manager that maintains sticky split-to-host assignments with per-query load balancing.
 *
 * This manager replaces the broadcast-based approach (BroadcastSplitLocalityManager) with a simpler, more efficient
 * driver-side assignment strategy:
 *
 *   1. **Sticky assignments**: Once a split is assigned to a host, it stays there unless the host becomes unavailable
 *      2. **Per-query load balancing**: New splits (unassigned or host unavailable) are assigned to hosts with the
 *      fewest splits IN THE CURRENT QUERY 3. **Zero per-query overhead**: No broadcast jobs, no network collection
 *
 * The key insight is that we track historical assignments for cache locality, but balance NEW assignments based on the
 * current query's workload distribution.
